                <h4 class="intro">project info<i class="fa-solid fa-eye-dropper"></i></h4>
                <p>This is a simple basic calculator made of pure javascript and html & css
                  Majorly it tasted the concept of in coporation of functions</P>
                <p>Since it was among my first project i was much happy and anxious to do more about
                  it keeps me motivated all through to update it much and more with time
                </p>
                <h4>Difficulty & Solution</h4>
                <p>The major challage i faced with this project was the logical error bit which needs a lot 
                    Of precise in order to solve it.
                </p>

                    <h4>WEATHER-APP<i class="fa-solid fa-cloud"></i> </h4>
                    <img src="./pictures/weather-app.png"class="image" alt="weather-app" >

                    <p>This is a weather Application that user can search weather temperatures 
                        of different places  and they get them displayed within a span of seconds
                    </p>
                    <p>The application uses a simple concept of APIS where am using fetch and promise 
                        to fetch data from weather database system && the application is majorly based 
                        under webpack bases
                    </p>
                    <h4>Difficulty && fixation</h4>
                    <p>The challage is fixing and setting the webpack enviroment still the achievement of 
                        getting used to new tools like Promises in fetch 
                    </p>

                    <p>Still this was a webpack bases application which shows the restaurant information 
                        the menu in the restaurant accommodation places and the location of the restaurant.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a purely JavaScript project with just little of css the concept of ES6 module 
                        is highly deploy in this project
                    </p>
                    <h4>Difficulty && fixation</h4>
                    <p>incorporation of the the those different modules together while using webpack
                        is a bit of a challage here but with precise persistence i was able to overcome that.

                    <p>This is a html5 && css simple made library-application where you can manually add some books
                        and still delete some but its not database managed.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have used a data structure array to act as my database for the time being where it only offer 
                        sessional storage i was really exicited when i designed it being my first dynamic web using vanilla javascript
                    </p>
                    <h4>Difficulty && fixes</h4>
                    <p>The great problem io faced with this application was at first i was new to arrays so knowing how to juggle around
                        them was a bit difficult for me to internalize but i sat down and learn the magic of array now am good to go with it right now

                    <p>This was one of most challaging one its a data structure called Merge-sort
                        where by you a given a disarranged data to sort it into the required order
                    </p>
                    <p>It uses the concept of the recursion and merging of data based on there index
                        i can say is one of my best data structure have done
                    </p>
                    <h4>Difficulty && fixes</h4>
                    <p>Sitting down and understanding the data-structure so that you can manually implement
                        it using a code was one of the faced problem but at longLast i fixed it nicely as can see in the picture <aside></aside>

                    <p>The biggest aim of desgining this portfolio was to come up with a responsive designed web application
                        with the help of the concept i had learnt i managed to figure it out plainly just give me a shout then kindly@@
